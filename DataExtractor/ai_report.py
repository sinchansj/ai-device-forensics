Rather than just listing findings, approach this like a detective piecing together a story. Analyze the communications data in particular, looking for significant patterns, shifts in behavior, and connections between contacts.

Highlight anything that stands out as potentially noteworthy, surprising, or indicative of a larger narrative.
